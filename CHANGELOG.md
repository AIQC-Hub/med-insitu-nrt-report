# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `scripts/build_summaries.R` and `scripts/dump_frames.R`, thin wrappers over
  `reportlib::build_summaries()` and `reportlib::fingerprint_frames()`.
- A **Source on GitHub** link in the navbar, pointing at this repo.

### Changed
- Input data now comes from `ctddump` + `seastamp` instead of the R-built summaries published as
  release assets. Figures change accordingly and are not reconciled against the previous site:
  MO 1,560 profiles, GL 73,028 profiles, CORA 71,816 profiles.
- The site is now built with **Quarto** instead of Distill. Pages are `.qmd`, `_site.yml` became
  `content/_quarto.yml`, and xaringanExtra panelsets became Quarto `::: {.panel-tabset}`.
- The shared functions and templates moved to the **`reportlib`** package. This repo now holds
  only its pages, `_func/common_site.Rmd`, its region files and `_quarto.yml`.

### Removed
- Pressure pages and the NRT vs CORA comparison pages.
- Four sections from every summary page: "Profile level QC flags", "Location Filtering",
  "Duplicate Profiles Within Platforms" and "Duplicate Profiles Across Platforms".

### Fixed
- The navbar title linked to the AIQC portal instead of this site's home page, so nothing in the
  menu bar led back to the index. Quarto folds the logo and the title into a single brand link,
  which `logo-href` then claimed in full; Distill kept the two apart. The title is now an ordinary
  nav item pointing at `index.qmd`, and the logo keeps the portal link and gains `AIQC` alt text
  (it had none, and the image is white on transparent).
